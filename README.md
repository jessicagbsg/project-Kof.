## About the project
My fist project created to practice my knowledge in ``HTML`` and ``CSS``.

The main purpuse of this study website was to exercise ``CSS`` properties such as: ``box model, flexbox, grid layout, selectors, psedo-elements, pseudo-classes.``
In addition to use an ``accesible and semantic HTML``.

### Running the project
To run/open the project, you just have to download the "index.html" file and open it with your browser. 

To edit or make changes, you have to download the whole project folder and edit as you like with your favorite IDE.
